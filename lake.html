        <h3>Exploring Earth's Lakes</h3>
        <p id="alttext" style="font-size:18px; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 1.5;">Lakes are some of the most captivating natural features on our planet, offering diverse landscapes and ecosystems
            across the globe. <strong>Lake Baikal</strong> in Russia stands out as the world's deepest and oldest freshwater
            lake, containing an astounding 20% of the world's unfrozen freshwater reserve. In North America,
            <strong>Lake Superior</strong> reigns as the largest freshwater lake by surface area, comparable in size to
            Austria and holding about 10% of the world's surface freshwater. Africa boasts <strong>Lake Victoria</strong>, the
            continent's largest lake by area, shared by Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya.</p>

        <p id="alttext" style="font-size:18px; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 1.5;">Europe is home to picturesque bodies of water like <strong>Lake Geneva</strong>, straddling Switzerland and
            France, known for its deep blue waters and surrounding mountains. In South America, <strong>Lake Titicaca</strong> holds
            the title of the highest navigable lake in the world, situated between Peru and Bolivia. Asia features the enormous
            <strong>Caspian Sea</strong>, which, despite its name, is actually the world's largest lake.</p>

        <p id="alttext" style="font-size:18px; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 1.5;">These lakes not only shape the geography of their regions but also play crucial roles in local ecosystems,
            supporting unique flora and fauna. Many, like Lake Baikal and Lake Tanganyika, are biodiversity hotspots,
            harboring species found nowhere else on Earth. From the waters of <strong>Crater Lake</strong> in Oregon to the saline
            expanse of the <strong>Dead Sea</strong> between Israel and Jordan, lakes around the world continue to captivate
            and inspire with their beauty and ecological significance.</p>
