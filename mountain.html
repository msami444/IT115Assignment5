    <h1>Climb the Mountain!</h1>
    <p>Mount Rainier, also known as Tahoma, is a prominent active stratovolcano located in the Cascade Range of
        Washington
        State. Standing at 14,411 feet (4,392 meters), it is the highest peak in the Pacific Northwest and the most
        topographically prominent mountain in the contiguous United States. The mountain is renowned for its stunning
        glaciers,
        with 25 major glaciers covering its slopes, making it the most heavily glaciated peak in the lower 48 states.
