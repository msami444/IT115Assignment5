             <p id="alttext" style="font-size:18px; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 1.5;">Mount Rainier, also known as Tahoma, is a prominent active stratovolcano located in the Cascade Range of Washington State.
           Standing at 14,411 feet (4,392 meters), it is the highest peak in the Pacific Northwest and the most topographically prominent 
           mountain in the contiguous United States. The mountain is renowned for its stunning glaciers, with 25 major glaciers covering 
           its slopes, making it the most heavily glaciated peak in the lower 48 states.</p>
